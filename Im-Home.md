How will we control our home appliances in ten years? Will every new device still be shipped with an extra remote control? A coffee table looking like a mess seems the inevitable.

As speech-based interfaces are still very prone to error, the investigation of a gesture-based interaction modality seems worthwhile, since in addition to voice gestures represent a natural form of communication for people.
