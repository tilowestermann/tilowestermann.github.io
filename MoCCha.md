Campus Charlottenburg is one of the largest contiguous, urban university campuses in Europe. It is also one of Germany's most diverse centers of excellence for science, the fine arts and design - embedded directly in the center of the German capital.

The "Campus Charlottenburg" project was initiated by Technische Universität Berlin, Universität der Künste Berlin, and the Borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. The two universities educate around 34.000 students and employ around 9.000 people in research, teaching, continuing education and administration, in addition to numerous researchers from other institutions.

Mobiler Campus Charlottenburg (MoCCha) is a mobile application for smartphones, providing useful information for students and visitors of the campus. MoCCha is used as a research platform at the Quality and Usability Lab of TU Berlin.
