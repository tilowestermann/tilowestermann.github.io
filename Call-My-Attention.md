“Call My Attention” is an application for immediate Line-of-Sight Signaling on Mobile Phones. The application proposes a mobile device function to be used like a remote control, for achieving immediate attention. It results from the Project “Speechless” at the [Design Research Lab](http://www.design-research-lab.org) of the University of the Arts in collaboration with T-Labs Berlin.

The project explores challenges and possibilites for disability-inspired interaction. Main goals are to find ways for enhancing Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) and Information-Communication-Technology (ICT) by transferring properties and principles from ‘disability’ context into general contexts of communication. Therefore we investigate on alternative interaction techniques inspired e.g. by deaf communication or blind navigation.
