CapWidgets are passive tangible controls for capacitive touch screens. CapWidgets bring back physical controls to off-the-shelf multi-touch surfaces as found in mobile phones and tablet computers. While the user touches the widget, the surface detects the capacitive marker on the widgetâ€™s underside. CapWidgets can be used with most mobile devices equipped with capacitive touch screens, e.g. Apples iPad, iPhone or similar devices.
